                    We designed a double supersonic converging-diverging nozzle to test a specific wedge shape. We used MATLAB extensively to calculate dimensions, startup power, and various thermodynamic properties based on our design space (working fluid, test section Mach number, and inlet stagnation temperature) then graphed the results in 2D and 3D plots. We then related our findings to the costs required to run the wind tunnel.

I worked on the blender attachment, ensuring it could screw onto the rest of the assembly. This project required an extreme commitment to teamwork and collaboration, as each of our individual designs would eventually combine into an assembly. At the end, we created a SOLIDWORKS animation that demonstrated the way the assembly would integrate each separate attachment. </span> </h2>
